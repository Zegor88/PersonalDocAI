## Study Description

The study was performed in multispiral mode using a standard protocol with subsequent image reconstruction.

- Sacral configuration is preserved.
- No signs of developmental anomalies or bone damage were detected.
- Subchondral sclerosis of the articular surfaces of the lateral masses of the sacrum is noted.
- In the left S2 lateral mass of the sacrum, a calcified formation measuring 1.6 × 2.5 cm is identified.
- In the right iliac wing, an area of osteosclerosis measuring 0.5 cm is identified.
- The coccyx axis is not deviated, the coccyx is not deformed in the sagittal projection.
- No pathological changes in the paravertebral soft tissues were detected.
